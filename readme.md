# Group 4 Final Project

This project is based on the `Group_4_Final_Project.ino` Arduino sketch. It is designed to demonstrate the integration of sensors, actuators, and user interaction using an Arduino microcontroller.

## Features

- Reads data from connected sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, light).
- Controls actuators such as LEDs, buzzers, or motors based on sensor input.
- Provides user feedback via serial monitor or display.
- Implements logic for automated responses to environmental changes.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (Uno, Mega, or compatible)
- Sensors (e.g., DHT11/DHT22, LDR, etc.)
- Actuators (LEDs, buzzer, relay, etc.)
- Jumper wires and breadboard

## Setup

1. Connect the sensors and actuators to the Arduino as specified in the code comments.
2. Open `Group_4_Final_Project.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the correct board and port.
4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino.

## Usage

- Monitor the serial output for sensor readings and system status.
- Interact with the system as described in the code (e.g., pressing buttons, changing light levels).

## Customization

- Modify sensor thresholds or actuator responses in the code to suit your project needs.
- Add additional sensors or outputs as required.
